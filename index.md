# Empowering Software through Machine Learning (ESwML)

# Overview

The software of tomorrow will heavily rely on the use of machine learning models. This will span various aspects including using Machine Learning (ML) models during the development time to enhance developer productivity, designing ML heuristics to improve application execution, and adopting surrogate Neural Networks (NN) models within applications to replace expensive computations and accelerate their performance. However, several challenges limit the broad adoption of ML in today's software.

For example, there are no programming language extensions that can capture the developer’s intent to use surrogate NN models in their applications, nor can task scheduling algorithms communicate seamlessly with ML heuristics to decide and schedule tasks.  As applications continue to get integrated into complex, deep software stacks with workflows, compilers, runtime libraries, and heterogeneous systems, it becomes necessary to use novel techniques for assisting software development, supporting the application execution orchestration, and potentially improving application performance.

The goal of Empowering Software through Machine Learning (ESwML) workshop is to establish a platform where researchers, scientists, application developers, computing center staff, and industry professionals can come together to exchange ideas and explore how artificial intelligence can help in effective and efficient use of future systems.

This workshop will actively drive discussion and aim to answer the following questions:
- How can we leverage the advances in Machine Learning to ease the software development process?
- How can ML be applied to automate heuristic design? These heuristics play a crucial role in: compile-time performance prediction, scheduling policies adopted by datacenters, cloud communities, and HPC programming models.
- How can we seamlessly integrate ML models into applications to improve their performance while ensuring the correctness of  the generated outputs?

# Empowering Software through Machine Learning (ESwML)

# Overview
The software of tomorrow will rely heavily on the use of Machine Learning models. This will span various aspects including using ML models during the development time to enhance developer productivity, designing ML heuristics to incorporate within applications to replace expensive computations and accelerate their performance. However, several challenges limit the widespread adoption of ML in today's software and constrain current and future software development.

The workshops on Empowering Software Development through Machine Learning (eSwML) aim to establish a platform where researchers, scientists, application developers, computing center staff, and industry professionals come together to exchange ideas and explore how artificial intelligence can help in effective and efficient software development.

**The organized workshops actively drive discussion and aim to answer several questions including the following:**	
1. How can we leverage the advances in Machine Learning to ease the software development process?	
2. What tools are missing to bridge the interaction with ML models during application development?			
3. Can we improve the accuracy and efficiency of ML models by exposing to them existing analytical tools? For example, enabling Large Language Models to interact with memory sanitizers etc. 
4. How can we seamlessly integrate ML models into applications to improve their performance while ensuring the correctness of the generated outputs?
